            <p>
              I currently live in London, but grew up in Derbyshire (hence the Ducky) and have spent
              the most time living in Norfolk and Norwich.

              I was diagnosed with coeliac disease in 2021 at the age of 22. Iâ€™d been struggling
              with a range of seemingly unconnected symptoms for many years, and these symptoms
              really escalated during the pandemic (which I put down to the fact that we jumped on
              the craft-beer and sourdough-baking bandwagons, and that was just too much gluten for
              my body to handle!).

          I do feel very grateful to have been diagnosed, and to know what was wrong . But I did
          feel very daunted by the idea of having to eat a 100% gluten-free forever, and the
          transition hasnâ€™t been completely smooth-sailing. I think the thing I miss the most is
          being able to find something or somewhere to eat spontaneously, which can be really
          difficult when you have to avoid gluten, especially contamination. And I still remember
          that first trip round the supermarket, and realising just how many of my favourite foods
          (and so many random things!) contain or â€˜may containâ€™ glutenâ€¦
        </p>{' '}
        <p>
          But, itâ€™s not all bad! I am so much healthier and happier now that I know to avoid gluten,
          and there is such an incredible online coeliac and gluten-free community that I get to be
          a part of who have helped me so much! So, I wanted to create my own website and blog, to
          hopefully contribute to this lovely community.

        <h2>About this website</h2>{' '}
        <p>
          In the â€˜Places to eatâ€™ section, I will be documenting, reviewing and cataloguing all of
          the gluten-free spots that I come across in the UK and beyond. Iâ€™ll always make sure to
          share key info, such as whether the place is fully GF or has safe cross-contamination
          practices. Once Iâ€™ve tried a few different places in a location, Iâ€™ll also write up a
          place-guide, which youâ€™ll be able to find in the â€˜Location guidesâ€™ section. In the
          â€˜Recipesâ€™ section, Iâ€™ll be sharing recipes (shocker!), and in the â€˜Blogâ€™ section, anything
          and everything else that I think might be helpful or interesting to share with my fellow
          gluten-avoiders.
