              Iâ€™m 25, and currently living in London. I grew up in Derbyshire (hence the Ducky), and
              then Norwich, which still has my heart.

              I was diagnosed with coeliac disease in April 2021. I had struggled with a range of
              seemingly unconnected symptoms for many years, but my symptoms escalated during the
              pandemic (I partly put this down to the fact that we jumped on the pandemic craft-beer
              and sourdough bandwagons, and that was just too much gluten for my body to handle). I
              got back in touch with my GP who referred me for tests, and I found out a few days
              later that I have coeliac disease.

          I am really grateful to have been diagnosed and to have an answer to what was wrong. But,
          I did initially feel very daunted by the idea of being 100% gluten-free forever (I still
          am sometimesâ€¦), and the transition to a fully GF diet hasnâ€™t always been smooth-sailing. I
          think the thing I miss the most is being able to find something or somewhere to eat
          spontaneously, which can be really difficult when you have to avoid gluten, especially
          cross-contamination. I also still remember that first trip round the supermarket after
          finding out I could never eat gluten again, and that sinking feeling of seeing â€˜may
          containsâ€™ on some of my favourite foodsâ€¦
        </p>{' '}
        <p>
          BUT, itâ€™s not all bad! Iâ€™m so grateful to feel healthier and happier now I know to avoid
          gluten, and that there is such an incredible online coeliac and gluten-free community that
          I get to be a part of as a result of my diagnosis! So, I wanted to create my own website
          and blog, to hopefully contribute to this lovely community.

        <h2>About this website</h2>{' '}
        <p>
          In the â€˜Places to Eatâ€™ section, I will be documenting, reviewing and cataloguing all of
          the gluten-free spots that I come across in the UK and beyond. Iâ€™ll always make sure to
          share key info, such as whether the place is fully GF or has safe cross-contamination
          practices. Once Iâ€™ve tried a few different places in a location, Iâ€™ll also write up a
          place-guide, which youâ€™ll be able to find in the â€˜Location Guidesâ€™ section. In the
          â€˜Recipesâ€™ section, Iâ€™ll be sharing recipes (shocker!), and in the â€˜Blogâ€™ section, anything
          and everything else that I think might be helpful or interesting to share with my fellow
          gluten-avoiders.
